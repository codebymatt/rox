A Ruby interpreter for the Lox programming language.

I've decided to follow along with the first section of Bob Nystrom's book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html) and
build an interpreter for the Lox programming language. This should serve two
purposes - providing a scratch for the ever nagging itch I have to understand
programming languages better, and stratch my Ruby skills beyond the usual Rails
application I write daily.

Bob has written his implementation in Java, which is actually nice since I'll
have to 'translate' it to Ruby, meaning I'll have to actually really understand
what's happening behind the scenes. It's also a great project excuseto get my Vim
up to scratch , so that should be interesting.
