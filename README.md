A Ruby interpreter for the Lox programming language.

I'm working through Bob Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) as a
foray into the practical workings of a programming language. At the time of writing this I work on a
team that develops and maintains [GROQ](https://github.com/sanity-io/GROQ), a query language for
JSON. While I've contributed here and there, I'm not as fluent as I'd like to be with what's
under the hood of any non-trivial language implementation.

I'm planning on covering the first section of the book with Ruby, a language I love but rarely use
in my day-to-day, and the second half in Go, my current daily driver.

(This is actually my second attempt at the first section of the book, the git history of this repo
reaches further back than I care to admit. The first time I raced through the material with too much
of a focus on _finishing it_, instead of _learning_. I am at least a little wiser now.)
