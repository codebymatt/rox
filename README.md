A Ruby interpreter for the Lox programming language.

I've decided to follow along with the first section of Bob Nystrom's book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) and
build an interpreter for the Lox programming language. This should serve two
purposes - providing a scratch for the ever nagging itch I have to understand
programming languages better, and stretch my Ruby skills beyond the usual Rails
application I write daily.

Bob has written his implementation in Java, which is convenient (for me at least) since I'll
have to 'translate' it to Ruby, meaning I'll have to really understand what's happening
behind the scenes.

Depending on how well that goes, I may continue on and write a VM for Lox (probably in C, and depending how that goes, maybe another low level language).
